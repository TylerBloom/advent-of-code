## ABOUT
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) are all here. All of my solutions are written in Rust.

## HOW TO USE
Really, this is just for reference, but if you want to run any of the code, simply use `cargo run` inside of the directory for the year you're interested in. The interface is exteremly simple. The answers to all the problems are printed out. If you would like to see a specific problem, comment the others out (again, this is **mostly** just for reference).

If you would like to see the progression from parts A to B, I *try* to commit after every solution, so you can track my progress.
